This is my config for nvim. It uses lazy vim and a bunch of plugins to optimize development flow. Current setup is supporting Lua, JS/TS and Odin languages.

To use it on your computer, clone the repo and put nvim into the ~/.config (it works for mac os, for other platforms please investigate it by yourselve)
